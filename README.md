# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Tic Tac Toe game was a personal project of mine. I wanted to create a game 
with a graphical user interface to play it on. I also wanted to experiment with 
creating a sort of AI that would make smart decisions based on the previous and 
currently available moves. Thus, I created this Tic Tac Toe game using python. 
In addition to my goals with this project, I got to practice writing code in a 
more object oriented way, and I was able to expose myself to a new python module 
in tkinter.
