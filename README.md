# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Tic Tac Toe game was a personal project of mine. I wanted to create a game 
with a graphical user interface to play it on. I also wanted to experiment with 
creating a sort of AI that would make smart decisions based on the previous and 
currently available moves. Thus, I created this Tic Tac Toe game using python. 
In addition to my goals with this project, I got to practice writing code in a 
more object oriented way, and I was able to expose myself to a new python module 
in tkinter.

I added an additional difficulty mode in my Tic Tac Toe game called ChatGPT AI Mode. This mode
calls to ChatGPT using an API so that the user is playing against a true AI. This was a fun way 
to apply my new experience in openai's API even though it turns out ChatGPT is not very good at Tic Tac Toe.
Note this mode can only be played after you input your own API_KEY to the code.
